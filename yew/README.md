# Yew todolist

I want to use Yew for one of my projects, so learning yew makes sense!

Another good point is that I'll be able to use that frontend for all the backend
todolists tutos to come.

## Dev starter pack

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked trunk
trunk serve
```
